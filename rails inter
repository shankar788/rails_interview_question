x = [{"a" => 10},{"b" => 20},{"c" => 30}]
How can you obtain the following?

one array containing all keys
another containing all values
the sum of all the values





Write a function that sorts the keys in a hash by the length of the key as a string. For instance, the hash:

list = [{"a" => 10}, {"b" => 20}, {"c" => 30}]

# Get all keys in an array
keys = list.map { |hash| hash.keys }.flatten
puts "Keys: #{keys}" # Output: Keys: ["a", "b", "c"]

# Get all values in an array
values = list.map { |hash| hash.values }.flatten
puts "Values: #{values}" # Output: Values: [10, 20, 30]

# Calculate the sum of all values
sum = values.sum
puts "Sum of values: #{sum}" # Output: Sum of values: 60



list = [{"a" => 10}, {"b" => 20}, {"c" => 30}]

# Get all keys in an array
keys = list.map(&:keys).flatten
puts "Keys: #{keys}" # Output: Keys: ["a", "b", "c"]

# Get all values in an array
values = list.map(&:values).flatten
puts "Values: #{values}" # Output: Values: [10, 20, 30]

# Calculate the sum of all values
sum = values.sum
puts "Sum of values: #{sum}" # Output: Sum of values: 60











hash = { abc: 'hello', 'another_key' => 123, 4567 => 'third' }

sorted_hash = hash.sort_by { |key, value| value }.to_h
puts sorted_hash.inspect





sort hash with key

{ abc: 'hello', 'another_key' => 123, 4567 => 'third' }

hash = { abc: 'hello', 'another_key' => 123, 4567 => 'third' }





a = hash.keys.map { |key| key.to_s }.sort_by { |key| key.length }

# a = hash.keys.map(&:to_s).sort_by(&:length)
puts a
